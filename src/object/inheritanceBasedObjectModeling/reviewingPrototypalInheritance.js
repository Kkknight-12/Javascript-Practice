// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
 * When you create a property by using the dot notation directly on the

 * when you’re writing your own libraries and frameworks for others to use
 * and want to do things such as hide a certain field from view or make some
 * fields immutable. Data descriptors help enforce certain design principles
 * and communicate clear intentions about how your APIs work.
 *
 * As you can see, Object.create offers a simple, elegant way to create
 * objects from a shared prototype and establishes the proper inheritance
 * linkage to resolve property lookups.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Property resolution process

/*
 * According to the ECMAScript specification, an internal reference known as
 * [[Prototype]] (accessible via the __proto__ property in objects) is
 * configured by Object.create and effectively links moneyTransaction to
 * transaction. This is the sole reason why we can
 * properly resolve moneyTransaction.sender to the value 'luis@tjoj.com',
 *
 * When requesting a member field, the JavaScript engine first looks for the
 * property in the calling object. If JavaScript can’t find the property
 * there, it looks in [[Prototype]]. The property sender is not declared in
 * money- Transaction, yet it still resolves successfully. Why? Any property
 * access or method invocation in moneyTransaction will travel up the
 * prototype chain, continuing to transaction until it finds the property
 * there and returns it. But what if it doesn’t? The lookup process would
 * continue further, finally terminating at the empty object lit- eral {}
 * (aka Object.prototype). If resolution fails, the result of the operation
 * is undefined for a value property or a TypeError for a function-valued
 * property.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, you can think of the hidden __proto__ property as
 * being the bridge that allows you to traverse the chain. When we use
 * prototypes to implement inheritance, which is the most common scenario,
 * we say that property resolution “moves up” the inheritance chain
 *
 * You should ** never use __proto__ ** directly in your applications, as it’s
 * meant to be used internally by the JavaScript engine. Hypothetically, if
 * surfaced in userland code, it would look something like this:
 *
 * const moneyTransaction = {
     __proto__: transaction,
     funds: 0.0,
     addFunds: function addFunds(funds = 0) {
       this.funds += Number(funds);
       return this;
  }
}
*
* If you need to manipulate this field, the recommended APIs are
* - Object.getPrototypeOf and
* - Object.setPrototypeOf.
* You can also call the Object#isPrototypeOf method directly on the object.
* */
console.log(
  "transaction is isPrototypeOf moneyTransaction ",
  transaction.isPrototypeOf(moneyTransaction)
);

console.log("Object.getPrototypeOf ", Object.getPrototypeOf(moneyTransaction));
//  { sender: 'luis@tjoj.com', recipient: 'luke@tjoj.com' }

const obj = {};
const parent = { foo: "bar" };

console.log(obj.foo);
// Expected output: undefined

Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, parent);

console.log("Object.getPrototypeOf ", Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); //  { foo: 'bar' }
console.log("Object.getPrototypeOf ", Object.getPrototypeOf(parent));
//   [Object: null prototype] {}

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Differential inheritance
/*
 * Differential inheritance, in which derived objects maintain references to
 * the objects from which they are derived, is common in prototypal
 * languages. In JavaScript, differential inheritance is called
 * [[Prototype]]. By contrast, in class-based inheritance, a derived object
 * copies all the state and behavior from its own class, as well as all its
 * derived classes. The key distinction is copy versus link.
 *
 * Although this term sounds a bit intimidating, differential inheritance is
 * a simple concept referring to how extended behavior separates a derived
 * object from its linked generic parent. If you think about a JavaScript
 * object as being a dynamic bag of properties, differentiation means
 * adding properties to another bag and linking the two bags. The prototype
 * resolution mechanism flows uni directionally from a calling object to its
 * linked object (and so on), any newly derived object is meant to
 * differentiate itself from its parent with new behavior. New behavior
 * includes adding new properties or even **overriding** an existing property
 * from a linked object (known as **shadowing** ). You can visit
 *  http://mng.bz/OEmR for more information.
 *
 * Consider another scenario in which we extend the generic transaction
 * object to define hashTransaction. This object differentiates itself from
 * its parent by adding a function (calculateHash) to compute its own hash
 * value. At a high level, hashing is using an object’s state to generate a
 * unique string value, much as JSON.stringify does, but we need to target
 * only the values, not the entire shape of the object. This hash value has
 * many uses in industry, such as fast insert/retrieval from hash tables or
 * dictionaries, as well as data integrity checks.
 *
